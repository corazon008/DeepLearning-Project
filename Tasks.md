# Projects
## General features:
- Students work by teams of 3. Each team have to choose a dataset (Kaggle, UCI ML…), and define their applicative 
scenario for using these data (application goal and context). The project must involve both classification and 
multi-outputs regression problems to be solved using structured data only. This part must be validated by the teacher.
- Any technical choice should be justified by the project’s needs and experimental observations.
- Each team will submit their code on the 17/12/2025 16h (moodle) Project presentations will be hold
on last session: 19/12/2025: 10’ presentation followed by questions.
- Each student will send a mail with a justified grade (/5) for each team member contribution on
the project (oneself included) on the 17/12/2025


## Missions:
- Implement MLP/DNN using the 3 frameworks you know (Scikit-learn/TensorFlow/Pytorch) to solve the
given problem.
- Ensure proper data preprocessing, evaluation and optimization of your models.
- The code should be of quality, following PEP-8 standards, well-documented and modular. For the defense,
you must be able to justify all previous choices.
- Any successful attempt to further adjust/personnalize your solution to the project’s needs will be rewarded.
